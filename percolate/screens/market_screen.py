"""Market: buying on one side, selling on the other.

A plain utility screen on purpose (see percolate.tcss's header comment) — no
ambient art or tint here, that "zen" budget belongs to the Farm and Roast
screens. Four lists, split by transaction direction rather than stacked in
one column: Buy Seeds / Buy Ingredients on the left, Sell Raw Beans / Sell
Roasted Products on the right. Tab or the arrow keys move focus between
lists; Enter
(ListView's default select) acts on the highlighted row — buy or sell one
unit. Upgrades live as contextual modals on the Farm and Roast screens now,
not here — they're a different kind of purchase (permanent perks, not
day-to-day trading).
